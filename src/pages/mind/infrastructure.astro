        I run a homelab because I'd rather own the things I depend on. Media, photos, passwords, recipes, budgeting, books — it all lives on hardware I control, accessible through Cloudflare tunnels on <code class="text-accent">*.upbir.ch</code> subdomains.
      </p>

      <p>
        The backbone is a Proxmox hypervisor, a Synology NAS for storage, and a couple of Portainer instances orchestrating containers. DNS filtering, segmented networks, automated backups. Nothing fancy — just reliable.

        There's also a remote site out in the countryside — a ranch property with Home Assistant running greenhouse automation (temperature, humidity, watering) and security cameras. Connected over LTE, managed remotely.
      </p>

      <p>
        The general philosophy: Docker Compose for everything, Cloudflare for access, Pi-hole for filtering, RAID + automated backups for peace of mind. If a service matters to daily life, it shouldn't depend on someone else's business model.

        Uģis Bērziņš, Riga. Software engineer by trade, but that's not the whole picture. This site exists because I got tired of the placeholder GIF that had been sitting on my domain for years.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-heading font-semibold text-accent !mt-10 !mb-3">Background</h2>

      <p>
        Grew up on a farm in the Latvian countryside — animals, chores, outdoors. The kind of childhood that quietly teaches you to figure things out on your own. Ended up studying computer science, and the farm kid became an engineer. Nobody planned it, it just happened.
      </p>

      <p>
        That background still shapes how I approach things. Don't overthink it, don't force it. I think about that when considering what kind of life to build.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-heading font-semibold text-accent !mt-10 !mb-3">How I work</h2>

      <p>
        I'd rather build something straightforward than clever. If it needs a wiki page to explain, something went wrong. I tend to spend more time understanding the problem than writing the solution — the code part is usually the quick bit.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-heading font-semibold text-accent !mt-10 !mb-3">What I care about</h2>

      <p>
        I read a lot of stoic philosophy — the real thing, not the internet caricature. The Practicing Stoic by Ward Farnsworth is probably the best book I own. Ryan Holiday's daily meditations are a morning habit. Dalio's idea about always thinking through second and third-order effects has stuck with me too — most bad decisions come from only looking at what happens next, not what happens after that.
      </p>

      <p>
        Long-term over short-term. Own what matters. Don't depend on someone else's platform when you can help it — goes for your infrastructure and your career.
      </p>

      <p>
        Say what you mean, skip the fluff. Latvian default setting.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-heading font-semibold text-accent !mt-10 !mb-3">The two sides</h2>

      <p>
        This site has a technical side and a creative side — different fonts, different colours, different feel. It's not a persona thing. The person who ships software and runs a homelab is the same one who buys vinyl, shoots film, and reads sci-fi until 2am.

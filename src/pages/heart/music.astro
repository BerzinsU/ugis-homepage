        I collect vinyl — a small, deliberate shelf rather than a sprawling collection. Film soundtracks, classic albums, the odd local pressing. Each record is there because it sounds better when you have to get up and flip the side.

        Film scores are a constant — Zimmer's work especially. There's something about music written to carry narrative weight that makes it great for both focused work and just sitting with a drink. Dark Side of the Moon and Rumours are the kind of records everyone owns for a reason.

        Analogue formats appeal to me in general. Vinyl, film photography — the friction is the point. Digital is convenient, but the tactile process of analogue changes how you engage with the thing.

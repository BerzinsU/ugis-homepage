      <p>
        I think in systems. Software, infrastructure, game mechanics, life decisions — same pattern recognition underneath. Find the structure, understand the constraints, work within them or change them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stoicism is the closest thing to an operating philosophy. Not the pop-culture "just don't feel things" version — the actual framework. Focus on what you control, accept what you don't, act with intention. The Practicing Stoic by Ward Farnsworth is the best book I've found on it.

      <p>
        I prefer natural development over forced optimization. The farm kid who herded animals and did chores turned into the engineer who builds systems — not because someone had a plan, but because the conditions were right. I think about that a lot when considering how to raise a kid and what kind of life to build.
      </p>

      <p>
        Long-term thinking over short-term wins. Clean value creation over extraction. Build things that last, own what matters, don't depend on someone else's platform when you can help it. That applies equally to self-hosting your services and to how you approach your career.
      </p>

      <p>
        Baltic directness: say what you mean, skip the padding, get to the point. Time is finite.

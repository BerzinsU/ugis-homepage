        Board games are a regular part of the week. I lean toward strategy — Brass: Birmingham, Scythe, Wingspan — the kind where your decisions compound and the system rewards understanding over luck. But a good party game has its place too.

        The design side is what pulls me deeper. I'm interested in how games create emergent behaviour from simple rules — adjacency effects, resource tension, meaningful trade-offs. That's what led to Hexagers.

        Hexagers is a hexagonal grid town builder I'm prototyping in Bevy (Rust). Mechanics-first — tile placement, adjacency bonuses, terrain effects. The goal is a calm, strategic builder where the hex grid itself creates interesting decisions. Still early, still iterating.

        Twenty years of playing games is slowly turning into making them. The shift from consumption to creation is the hard part.

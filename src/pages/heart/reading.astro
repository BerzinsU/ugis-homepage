        I read mostly sci-fi and fantasy — the kind that builds systems and worlds you can get lost in. Tchaikovsky, Sapkowski, Weir. When I find a series that clicks, I tend to consume the whole thing in a few weeks. Dungeon Crawler Carl was seven books in six weeks.

        Outside fiction, it's stoic philosophy and the occasional book on thinking, design, or craft. The Practicing Stoic sits on the shelf as a reference. Ryan Holiday's daily meditations are a morning constant.

        I also read about game design — not just theory, but how designers think about systems, feedback loops, and player motivation. It bleeds into how I think about software too.

            <p>
              14+ years building web applications. Currently working on shipping platforms with TypeScript and Nuxt — close to the business side, turning requirements into working software.
            </p>

            <p>
              I like building things that don't need me watching over them. Internal tools where the rest of the team can safely manage configs and edge cases on their own — so things keep running while I'm on vacation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Vue is my framework of choice — pragmatic, stays out of the way, and the ecosystem around Nuxt and the composition API just makes sense. Before that it was Clojure, and before that .NET. The stack changes; the way I pick apart problems doesn't.
            </p>

            <p>
              I run a homelab — Proxmox, Docker Compose, Cloudflare tunnels, automated backups. I'd rather own the stuff I depend on daily than hope someone else keeps their service running.
            </p>

            <p>
              I do Advent of Code each December — good fun and a nice break from production code.

            <p>
              I read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy — from Asimov to Dinniman. Some stoic philosophy and the occasional book on game design.
            </p>

            <p>
              I have a small vinyl shelf — film scores, classic albums, the odd local pressing. I also shoot film and practice drawing — pencil, markers, digital. Interests come, go, and come back. There's something about analogue formats that I keep returning to.
            </p>

            <p>
              I play a lot of games — PC mostly, but board games too sometimes. I like thinking about why some games work and others don't. That's slowly turning into actually making one — prototyping a hex-grid town builder in Bevy/Rust after tinkering with Blender and UE5 first.
            </p>

            <p>
              Away from screens — I grow peppers in a greenhouse with automated watering and climate sensors, and I built an outhouse at the family homestead. Modeled the whole thing to scale in Blender first to figure out exactly how many planks and beams to buy. The farm kid and the engineer don't stay separate for long.
